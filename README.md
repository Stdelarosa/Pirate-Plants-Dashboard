# Pirate Plants Dashboard
Power BI Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview
### Objective
<ul>

  <li>Demonstrate my ability to create data-driven dashboards for business decision-making.</li>

  <li>Analyze year-to-date (YTD) performance metrics for quantity and profitability, and identify trends across countries and products.</li>
</ul>

### Business Problem
<ul>
  <li>Scenario</li>
  Pirate Plants is a fictitious company that specializes in selling plants and gardening supplies globally. The company's management team needs a tool to monitor sales quantity performance across different countries and product categories. They want to identify underperforming regions, compare current performance to the previous year, and highlight trends that can guide their strategic decisions. The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights and help stakeholders make informed choices.

  <li>Key Goals
    <ul>
      <li>Identify bottom-performing countries by YTD vs PYTD metrics</li>
      <li>Visualize monthly trends and product category performance</li>
      <li>Provide actionable insights into account profitability</li>
    </ul>
  
  </li>
</ul>

### Process and Tools
<ul>
  <li>Data Preparation
    <ul>
      <li> Cleaned and transformed raw sales data using Power Query in Power BI</li>
      <li> Aggregated data by year, country, product categories, and profitability metrics</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design Choices
    <ul>
      <li>Tree Map: Highlighted bottom-performing countries for quick identification</li>
      <li>Waterfall Chart: Visualized increases and decreases in monthly quantity performance</li>
      <li>Bar Chart: Tracked YTD and PYTD values over time for trend analysis</li>
      <li>Scatter Plot: Segmented accounts by GP% and quantity to identify outliers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tools and Techniques
    <ul>
      <li>Power BI for Data Visualization</li>
      <li>DAX (Data Analysis Expression) for calculated measures (e.g, GP%, YTD vs PYTD metrics)</li>
      <li>Interactive slicers for filtering by year and performance type</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

### Key Insights
<ul>
  <li>Quantity Performance
    <ul>
      <li> In 2023, China and France experienced the largest YTD declines, indicating significant underperformance in these regions.</li>
      <li>In 2024, Canada and the United States show the largest YTD declines, highlighting new areas for strategic focus.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sales Performance
    <ul>
      <li> In 2023, China and Sweden ranked as the bottom two performers by sales, showing potential market challenges in these regions.</li>
      <li>In 2024, Canada and Colombia became the weakest performers by sales, requiring further analysis to understand declining revenue trends.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>General Trends
    <ul>
      <li> Monthly trends in both quantity and sales show notable increases in March.</li>
  </li>
</ul>
</ul>
